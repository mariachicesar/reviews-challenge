# Using Hooks, Context.Provide, useEffect, and useMemo
Be able to map through a list of reviews and reply

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/reviews](http://localhost:3000/reviews) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

It Runs but it fails. I believe its something with deconstructing Context.Provider.

### Description

Libraries I used:
-stars
-react-bootstrap
-react-router-dom

One can add reply to a review and also edit. One can go back and forth between details and list while preserving the changes in state. Only way to start fresh is to refres page.

UI is also responsive.

Thank you for the opportunity I have learned how to use Hooks better and can now restart refactoring my Class & Functional Components into new React.js Versioning. I have learn new skills by doing this challenge including some testing.
